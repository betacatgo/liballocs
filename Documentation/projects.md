For smaller projects (and some larger!) please check the issues on
GitHub. This includes some quality-of-implementation issues,
performance optimisations and usability improvements.

Existing use cases:
* run-time type checking: libcrunch
* linking-related
    - Jon French's use of liballocs tools to create a run-time interface model of the Linux kernel (more soon!)
* multi-language programming without foreign function interfacing APIs
    - CPython extension module (Guillaume Bertholon)
* fine-grained versioning and adaptation of binary interfaces
    - see liballocs's ancestor project, Cake (https://humprog.org/~stephen/research/cake)

For possible large-scale use cases, the list in the README is the
definitive list.
